  description: |
    This template detects insecure network security configurations in the Android manifest or network security configuration file. Misconfigurations can lead to security issues like allowing cleartext traffic, accepting untrusted certificates, or exposing sensitive network details.
  remediation: |
    Review and update the network security configuration to follow best practices, ensuring that all traffic uses HTTPS and that only trusted certificates are accepted. Example:

    ```xml
    <network-security-config>
        <domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="false">
            <domain includeSubdomains="true">example.com</domain>
            <trust-anchors>
                <certificates src="system" />
            </trust-anchors>
        </domain-config>
    </network-security-config>
    ```
