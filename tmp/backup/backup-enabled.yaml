  description: |
    This template detects if the `android:allowBackup` attribute is not explicitly set to `false`. Applications that do not disable this setting may allow unauthorized data backups via adb, which could lead to leakage of sensitive information.
  remediation: |
    Set `android:allowBackup="false"` in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file to prevent unauthorized backups of application data, especially if the app handles sensitive information.
