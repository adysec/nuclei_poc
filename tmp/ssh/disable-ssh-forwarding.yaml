  name: Disable SSH Forwarding
  author: pussycat0x
  severity: info
  description: |
    Port forwarding enables a host to proxy for another, which is often unnecessary and can pose security risks. If your server has a GUI, disable X11 forwarding when using SSH, as it wasn't designed with security in mind.
  remediation: |
    Change it to : X11Forwarding no and AllowTcpForwarding no
