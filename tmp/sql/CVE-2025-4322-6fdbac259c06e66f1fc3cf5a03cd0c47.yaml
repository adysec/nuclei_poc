  name: >
    Motors <= 5.6.67 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via Password Update/Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Motors theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 5.6.67. This is due to the theme not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user passwords, including those of administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.
