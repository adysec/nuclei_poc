  name: "Responsive Lightbox2 <= 1.0.2 - Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Responsive Lightbox2 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘hyperlink’ attribute in versions up to, and including, 1.0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
