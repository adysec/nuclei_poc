  description: "This module enables you to generate print versions of content. Some installations of the module make use of the dompdf/dompdf third-party dependency. Security vulnerabilities exist for versions of dompdf/dompdf < 2.0.0 See the library release notes for more detail: https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/releases/tag/v2.0.0 Note on 3rd party vulnerabilities This security advisory corresponds to a 3rd party vulnerability. Normally the Drupal Security Team would not issue advisories related to 3rd party code that is shipped separately from a module per our policy (most recent update is PSA-2019-09-04). In this case, because the module required a specific version and could not be updated without a change to the Drupal module we do issue an advisory."
