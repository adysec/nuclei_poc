  description: "The Media Library Block module allows you to render a media entity in a block. The module does not properly check media access in some circumstances. This may result in unauthorized users (including anonymous users) seeing media items they are not authorized to access if a block containing a restricted media item is placed on the page. Administrators may mitigate this vulnerability by removing blocks referencing media items that have access restrictions."
