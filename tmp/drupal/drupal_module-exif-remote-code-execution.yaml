  description: "This module enables you to automatically scan images uploaded to the site to extract their meta data and store it in taxonomy structures. The module doesnt sufficiently protect against malicious files being used to attack the site. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have permission to upload images to the site."
