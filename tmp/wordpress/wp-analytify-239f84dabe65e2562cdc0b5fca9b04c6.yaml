  name: "Analytify â€“ Google Analytics Dashboard For WordPress <= 4.2.2 - Authorization Bypass"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Analytify plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability and nonce checks on the analytify_delete_cache function in versions up to, and including, 4.2.2 . This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to delete the cache of the plugin and also allows unauthenticated attackers to delete the plugin cache via forged request, granted they can trick a subscriber or higher into clicking on a link. Version 4.2.3 adds a nonce check to the function, which addressed the Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability and makes exploitation impractical for lower-level accounts."
