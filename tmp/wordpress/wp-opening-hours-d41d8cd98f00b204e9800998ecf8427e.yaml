  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Opening Hours plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.3.0, via the "Set Details" meta box. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
