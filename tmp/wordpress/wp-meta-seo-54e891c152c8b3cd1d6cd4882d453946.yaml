info:
  name: "WP Meta SEO <= 4.5.2 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) SQL Injection"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The WP Meta SEO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ‘ids’ parameter in the bulkImageCopy function reachable via the wp_ajax_wpms AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 4.5.2 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level privileges to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. Since the plugin relied on nonce checks as a means of access control, and that nonce was made accessible to all authenticated users regardless of role, the vulnerability could be exploited by asubscribers."
