  name: "WP RSS Aggregator – News Feeds, Autoblogging, Youtube Video Feeds and More <= 4.6.3 - Authorization Bypass"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The WP RSS Aggregator – News Feeds, Autoblogging, Youtube Video Feeds and More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the wprss_check_if_blacklist_delete() function in versions up to, and including, 4.6.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts."
