  name: "WP-MUI – Mass User Input – Add and Export WP Users Quickly <= 1.8 - Missing Authorization"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The WP-MUI – Mass User Input – Add and Export WP Users Quickly plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks on various functions found in the ~/core/ajax_handler.php file in versions up to, and including, 1.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber level permissions and above to perform unauthorized actions."
