info:
  name: "WP Easy Gallery <= 2.7 - SQL Injection"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The WP Easy Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to generic SQL Injection via the 'galleryId' or 'select_gallery' parameters found in the ‘admin/add-images.php’ file in versions up to, and including, 2.7 due to insufficient escaping on the user-supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated admin+ attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database."
