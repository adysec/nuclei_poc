  name: >
    WP-DownloadManager <= 1.68.10 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Arbitrary File Read
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP-DownloadManager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file read in all versions up to, and including, 1.68.10. This is due to a lack of restriction on the directory an administrator can select for storing downloads. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to download and read any file on the server, including system and configuration files.
