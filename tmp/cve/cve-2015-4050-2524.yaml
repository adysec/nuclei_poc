  severity: high
  description: FragmentListener in the HttpKernel component in Symfony 2.3.19 through 2.3.28, 2.4.9 through 2.4.10, 2.5.4 through 2.5.11, and 2.6.0 through 2.6.7, when ESI or SSI support enabled, does not check if the _controller attribute is set, which allows remote attackers to bypass URL signing and security rules by including (1) no hash or (2) an invalid hash in a request to /_fragment.
