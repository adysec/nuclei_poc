    Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for WooCommerce <= 1.1.6 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload via upload Function
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.6 due to accepting a user‚Äêsupplied supported_type string and the uploaded filename without enforcing real extension or MIME checks within the upload() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
