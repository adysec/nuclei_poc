    WP Zendesk for Contact Form 7, WPForms, Elementor, Formidable and Ninja Forms <= 1.1.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Zendesk for Contact Form 7, WPForms, Elementor, Formidable and Ninja Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the settings_page() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
