  name: >
    Ultimate Classified Listings <= 1.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Ultimate Classified Listings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the update_profile function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify victim's email via a forged request, which might lead to account takeover, granted they can trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
