    NewsBlogger <= 0.2.5.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Plugin Installation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The NewsBlogger theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 0.2.5.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the newsblogger_install_and_activate_plugin() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files and achieve remote code execution via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
