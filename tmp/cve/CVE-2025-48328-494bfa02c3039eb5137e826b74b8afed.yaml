  description: >
    The Real Time Validation for Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.0.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized action granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
