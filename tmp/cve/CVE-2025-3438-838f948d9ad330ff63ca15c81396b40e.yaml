    MStore API – Create Native Android & iOS Apps On The Cloud <= 4.17.4 - Unauthenticated Limited Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The MStore API – Create Native Android & iOS Apps On The Cloud plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to limited privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 4.17.4. This is due to a lack of restriction of role when registering. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to to register with the 'wcfm_vendor' role, which is a Store Vendor role in the WCFM Marketplace – Multivendor Marketplace for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress. The vulnerability can only be exploited if the WCFM Marketplace – Multivendor Marketplace for WooCommerce plugin is installed and activated. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 4.17.3.
