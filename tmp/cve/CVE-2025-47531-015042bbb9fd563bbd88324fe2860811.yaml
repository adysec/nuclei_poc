    XT Event Widget for Social Events <= 1.1.7 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Local File Inclusion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The XT Event Widget for Social Events plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion via the render_facebook_event_listing() function in versions up to, and including, 1.1.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.
