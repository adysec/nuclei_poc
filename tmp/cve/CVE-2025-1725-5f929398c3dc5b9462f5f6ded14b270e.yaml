    Bit File Manager – 100% Free & Open Source File Manager and Code Editor for WordPress <= 6.7 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File Uploads
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Bit File Manager – 100% Free & Open Source File Manager and Code Editor for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 6.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.
