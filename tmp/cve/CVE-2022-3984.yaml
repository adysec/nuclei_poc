id: CVE-2022-3984

info:
  name: "Flowerplayer Video Player <= 1.0.4 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Flowerplayer Video Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘flowplayer6_video_shortcode’ function in versions up to, and including, 1.0.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for contributor-level attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
