  name: >
    Browse As <= 0.2 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Authentication Bypass via Cookie
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Browse As plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 0.2. This is due to incorrect authentication checking in the 'IS_BA_Browse_As::notice' function with the 'is_ba_original_user_COOKIEHASH' cookie value. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the user id.
