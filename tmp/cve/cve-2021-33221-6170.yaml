id: CVE-2021-33221

  name: CommScope Ruckus IoT Controller Unauthenticated Service Details
  author: geeknik
  description: A 'service details' API endpoint discloses system and configuration information to an attacker without requiring authentication. This information includes DNS and NTP servers that the devices uses for time and host resolution. It also includes the internal hostname and IoT Controller version. A fully configured device in production may leak other, more sensitive information (API keys and tokens).
