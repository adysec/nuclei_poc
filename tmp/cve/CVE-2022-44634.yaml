id: CVE-2022-44634

info:
  name: "S2W – Import Shopify to WooCommerce <= 1.1.12 - Authenticated (Admin+) Local File Inclusion"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The S2W – Import Shopify to WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 1.1.12, via insufficient restrictions in the 'generate_log_ajax' function. This allows administrator-level attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included."
