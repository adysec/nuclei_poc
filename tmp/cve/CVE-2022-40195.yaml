info:
  name: "PCA Predict <= 1.0.3 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The PCA Predict plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘blockip’ parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.0.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
