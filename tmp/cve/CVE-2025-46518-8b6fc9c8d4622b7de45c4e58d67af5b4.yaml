    IGIT Related Posts With Thumb Image After Posts <=  4.5.3 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The IGIT Related Posts With Thumb Image After Posts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including,  4.5.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
