id: CVE-2021-24499

info:
  name: >
    Workreap - Freelance Marketplace and Directory WordPress Theme < 2.2.2 - Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Workreap WordPress theme before 2.2.2 AJAX actions workreap_award_temp_file_uploader and workreap_temp_file_uploader did not perform nonce checks, or validate that the request is from a valid user in any other way. The endpoints allowed for uploading arbitrary files to the uploads/workreap-temp directory. Uploaded files were neither sanitized nor validated, allowing an unauthenticated visitor to upload executable code such as php scripts.
