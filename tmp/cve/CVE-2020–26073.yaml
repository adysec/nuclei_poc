  description: |
    A vulnerability in the application data endpoints of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information.

    The vulnerability is due to improper validation of directory traversal character sequences within requests to application programmatic interfaces (APIs).
