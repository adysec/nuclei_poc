  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The FLAP - Business WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.5 via deserialization of untrusted input [from the vulnerable parameter?|in the vulnerable function?]. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
