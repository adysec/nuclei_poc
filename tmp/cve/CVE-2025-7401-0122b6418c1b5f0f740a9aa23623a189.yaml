    Premium Age Verification / Restriction for WordPress <= 3.0.2 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Read and Write via remote_tunnel.php
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Premium Age Verification / Restriction for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file read and write due to the existence of an insufficiently protected remote support functionality in remote_tunnel.php in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read from or write to arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make the exposure of sensitive information or remote code execution possible.
