    WPAMS <= 44.0 (17-08-2023) - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WPAMS - Apartment Management System for wordpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in all versions up to, and including, 44.0 (17-08-2023). This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
