info:
  name: >
    WpEvently <= 4.3.6 - Authenticated (Contributor+) PHP Object Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WpEvently plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 4.3.6 via deserialization of untrusted input. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
