  name: >
    Homey <= 2.4.2 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation in homey_save_profile
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Homey theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.2. This is due to the plugin allowing users who are registering new accounts to set their own role. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain elevated privileges by creating an account with the Administrator, Editor, or Shop Manager role.
