info:
  name: Eclipse Jetty Integer Overflow in Chunk Size Parsing
  author: ProjectDiscoveryAI
  severity: critical
  description: |
    In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all configurations), and 9.4.x (non-default configuration with RFC2616 compliance enabled),
    transfer-encoding chunks are handled poorly. The chunk length parsing was vulnerable to an integer overflow. Thus a large chunk size could be
    interpreted as a smaller chunk size and content sent as chunk body could be interpreted as a pipelined request. If Jetty was deployed behind an
    intermediary that imposed some authorization and that intermediary allowed arbitrarily large chunks to be passed on unchanged, then this flaw
    could be used to bypass the authorization imposed by the intermediary as the fake pipelined request would not be interpreted by the intermediary
    as a request.
