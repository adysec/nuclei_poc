    WPAMS <= 44.0 (17-08-2023) - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WPAMS - Apartment Management System for wordpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 44.0 (17-08-2023) due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
