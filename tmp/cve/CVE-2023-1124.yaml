info:
  name: "Shopping Cart & eCommerce Store <= 5.4.2 - Authenticated (Admin+) Local File Inclusion via import_file_url"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Shopping Cart & eCommerce Store plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 5.4.2 via the import_file_url parameter. This allows authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included."
