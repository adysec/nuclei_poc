  name: >
    WPBookit <= 1.0.4 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WPBookit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the handle_image_upload() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
