  description: |
    This template detects hardcoded sensitive data such as passwords, keys, or tokens in the source code. Hardcoding sensitive data can lead to security breaches if the code is exposed or decompiled. It is recommended to use secure storage solutions.
  remediation: |
    To remediate this issue, remove hardcoded sensitive data from the source code and use secure storage solutions such as encrypted storage or secure key management services. Example:

    ```java
    // Store sensitive data securely, avoid hardcoding
    String password = getPasswordFromSecureStorage();
    ```
