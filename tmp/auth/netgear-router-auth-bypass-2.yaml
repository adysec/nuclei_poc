  name: Netgear DGN2200v1 Router Authentication Bypass
  author: gy741
  severity: high
  description: NETGEAR decided to use to check if a page has “.jpg”, “.gif” or “ess_” substrings, trying to match the entire URL. We can therefore access any page on the device, including those that require authentication, by appending a GET variable with the relevant substring (like “?.gif”).
