  name: "myCred – Points, Rewards, Gamification, Ranks, Badges & Loyalty Plugin <= 2.4.6.1 - Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The myCred – Points, Rewards, Gamification, Ranks, Badges & Loyalty plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in versions up to, and including, 2.4.6.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
