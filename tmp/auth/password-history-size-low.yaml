  name: Password History Size Too Low
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: Checks if the password history count is too low or not configured, allowing password reuse.
  impact: |
    A low or unset password history setting may allow users to reuse recently used passwords, increasing the risk of password compromise.
  remediation: |
    Increase the password history count to at least 24 previous passwords to prevent rapid reuse of old passwords.
