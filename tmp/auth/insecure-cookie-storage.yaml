  name: Insecure Cookie Storage
  author: YoruYagami
  severity: high
  description: |
    This template detects insecure storage of cookies in WebView. Storing cookies in plain text can expose them to unauthorized access, leading to potential security issues such as session hijacking.
  remediation: |
    To remediate this issue, use secure storage mechanisms for cookies and ensure that sensitive cookies are marked as HttpOnly and Secure. Example:

    ```java
    // Use secure storage mechanisms for cookies
    CookieManager cookieManager = CookieManager.getInstance();
    cookieManager.setAcceptCookie(true);
    cookieManager.setCookie("https://example.com", "sessionId=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure");
    ```
