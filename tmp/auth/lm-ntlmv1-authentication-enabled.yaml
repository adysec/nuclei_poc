  name: LM and NTLMv1 Authentication Enabled
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: Checks if LM and NTLMv1 authentication protocols are enabled, which are insecure.
  impact: |
    Legacy authentication methods such as LM and NTLMv1 are vulnerable to brute-force and pass-the-hash attacks.
  remediation: |
    Disable LM and NTLMv1 and enforce NTLMv2 or Kerberos for secure authentication.
