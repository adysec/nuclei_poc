  name: Basic Authentication Credentials Detection
  author: YoruYagami
  severity: high
  description: |
    This template detects the presence of hardcoded Basic Authentication credentials in the application code. Storing sensitive credentials like usernames and passwords directly in the code can lead to credential leakage and unauthorized access if an attacker is able to extract these values through reverse engineering. Basic Authentication over insecure channels can also expose these credentials to interception.
  remediation: |
    Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in the application code. Use secure storage mechanisms such as the Android Keystore System or retrieve credentials from a secure backend service at runtime. If Basic Authentication is required, ensure it is used over secure channels (HTTPS) to protect credentials during transmission.
