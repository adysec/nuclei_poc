  name: Hardcoded API Keys
  author: YoruYagami
  severity: high
  description: |
    This template detects hardcoded API keys in the source code. Hardcoding API keys can lead to unauthorized access and abuse if the keys are extracted by attackers. It is recommended to securely store and manage API keys.
  remediation: |
    To remediate this issue, remove hardcoded API keys from the source code and use secure storage solutions such as environment variables, encrypted storage, or secure key management services. Example:

    ```java
    // Store API keys securely, avoid hardcoding
    String apiKey = getApiKeyFromSecureStorage();
    ```

file:
  - extensions:
      - java
      - xml
      - json

    matchers:
      - type: regex
        regex:
          - "apikey=\"[A-Za-z0-9]+\""
          - "API_KEY = \"[A-Za-z0-9]+\""
