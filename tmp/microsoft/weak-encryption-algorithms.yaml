  severity: medium
  description: |
    This template detects the use of weak encryption algorithms such as MD5 or SHA-1 in the source code. Weak encryption algorithms are vulnerable to attacks and should be replaced with stronger algorithms like SHA-256 or SHA-3.
  remediation: |
    To remediate this issue, replace weak encryption algorithms with stronger ones. Example:

    ```java
    // Use SHA-256 instead of MD5
    MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
    byte[] hash = digest.digest(input.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
    ```
