  name: "MSMC Redirect After Comment <= 2.1.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The MSMC Redirect After Comment plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘MSMC_redirect_location’ parameter in versions up to, and including, 2.1.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform almost any action an admin can if they can successfully trick an admin into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
