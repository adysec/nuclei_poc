  description: |
    This template detects the loading of insecure content in WebView, such as content from untrusted sources or local file URLs. Loading insecure content can expose the application to various security risks, including XSS attacks.

    To remediate this issue, ensure that WebView only loads content from trusted sources and avoid loading local file URLs. Example:

    ```java
    // Load content from trusted sources
    webView.loadUrl("https://trusted.domain.com");
    ```

  - extensions:
      - java

      - type: word
        words:
          - "webView.loadUrl"
