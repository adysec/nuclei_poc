  name: Webview loadUrl Usage
  author: YoruYagami
  severity: medium
  description: |
    This template detects the use of `loadUrl` in WebView. Loading URLs directly in WebView can introduce security risks if the URLs are not validated or sanitized. This can lead to phishing attacks, cross-site scripting, or loading malicious content.
  remediation: |
    Ensure that the URLs loaded in WebView are properly validated and sanitized. Avoid loading URLs from untrusted sources and implement input validation to prevent injection attacks.
