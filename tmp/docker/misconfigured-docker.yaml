  name: Docker Container - Misconfiguration Exposure
  author: dhiyaneshDK
  severity: critical
  description: A Docker container misconfiguration was discovered. The Docker daemon can listen for Docker Engine API requests via three different types of Socket - unix, tcp, and fd. With tcp enabled, the default setup provides un-encrypted and un-authenticated direct access to the Docker daemon. It is conventional to use port 2375 for un-encrypted, and port 2376 for encrypted communication with the daemon.
