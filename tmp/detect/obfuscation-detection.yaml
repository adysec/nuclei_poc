  severity: medium
  description: |
    This template checks for obfuscation in the application. Lack of obfuscation makes it easier for attackers to reverse engineer the app. Applications without obfuscation tend to have readable class, method, and variable names.
  remediation: |
    Use ProGuard or R8 to obfuscate the application code and reduce the risk of reverse engineering.
