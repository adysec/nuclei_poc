  name: "Jetpack – WP Security, Backup, Speed, & Growth < 4.2 - CSV Injection"
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: "The Jetpack – WP Security, Backup, Speed, & Growth plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CSV Injection in versions up to, and including, 4.2. This allows unauthenticated attackers to embed untrusted input into data via contact forms that will be injected into exported CSV files. This can result in code execution when these files are downloaded and opened on a local system with a vulnerable configuration."
