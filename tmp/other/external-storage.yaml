  author: YoruYagami
  severity: high
  description: |
    This template identifies the use of external storage directories (e.g., `/sdcard`, `/storage/emulated/0`, `/mnt/sdcard`) in the application code. Files stored in these directories are globally readable and writable, making them accessible by any application or user. Sensitive information should not be stored on external storage due to the lack of security controls. Additionally, executable files stored in external storage must be cryptographically verified before dynamic loading to prevent code injection attacks.
  remediation: |
    Avoid storing sensitive data or executables on external storage. Use internal storage or encrypted storage mechanisms instead. If dynamic loading of executables is necessary, implement cryptographic checks to ensure file integrity and authenticity.
