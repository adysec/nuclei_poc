  name: "Two Way Chat <= 3.1.4 - Authenticated (Admin+) Local File Inclusion"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Two Way Chat plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 3.1.4 due to improper validation and sanitization of user input. This allows authenticated Admin+ attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included."
