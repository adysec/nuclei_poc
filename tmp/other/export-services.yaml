  name: Exported Services
  author: YoruYagami
  severity: high
  description: |
    This template detects if services are exported in the Android manifest file. Exporting services can expose them to other applications, which might lead to unauthorized access or actions within the app. Ensure that only necessary services are exported and that they are properly secured.
  remediation: |
    To remediate this issue, set the `exported` attribute to `false` for services that do not need to be accessible by other applications. Example:

    ```xml
    <service
        android:name=".MyService"
        android:exported="false"
        ... >
        ...
    </service>
    ```

file:
  - extensions:
      - xml

      - type: word
        words:
          - "android:exported=\"true\""
