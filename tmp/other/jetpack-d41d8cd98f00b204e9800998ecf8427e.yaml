  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Jetpack – WP Security, Backup, Speed, & Growth plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting via LaTeX markup within HTML elements in versions up to, and including, 3.9.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser."
