  name: Insecure Cipher Suites Enabled
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: Checks if insecure cipher suites are enabled.
  impact: |
    Enabling insecure cipher suites can lead to weak encryption, making it easier for attackers to decrypt sensitive data.
  remediation: |
    Disable insecure cipher suites such as those using RC4 or DES encryption.
