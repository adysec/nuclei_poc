  name: Android Insecure Data Storage Detection
  author: YoruYagami
  severity: high
  description: |
    This template identifies the use of insecure file storage modes, such as `MODE_WORLD_READABLE` and `MODE_WORLD_WRITABLE`. These modes allow files stored in internal storage to be shared between applications, exposing them to potential unauthorized access by other applications, including malicious ones. It is recommended to avoid using these modes and rely on secure storage mechanisms provided by the Android platform.
  remediation: |
    Remove the use of `MODE_WORLD_READABLE` and `MODE_WORLD_WRITABLE` in your application's file storage. Use the default internal storage permissions or consider using encrypted storage mechanisms to protect sensitive data.
