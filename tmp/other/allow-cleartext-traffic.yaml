  name: Allow Cleartext Traffic
  author: YoruYagami
  severity: medium
  description: |
    This template detects if cleartext traffic is allowed in the Android manifest file. Allowing cleartext traffic (HTTP) can expose sensitive data to network sniffing and man-in-the-middle attacks. It is recommended to enforce HTTPS to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
  remediation: |
    To remediate this issue, set the `usesCleartextTraffic` and `cleartextTrafficPermitted` attributes to `false` in the applicationâ€™s network security configuration. Example:

    ```xml
    <application
        android:usesCleartextTraffic="false"
        ... >
        ...
    </application>
    ```

    Example:

    ```xml
    <network-security-config>
        <domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="false">
            ...
        </domain-config>
    </network-security-config>
    ```
