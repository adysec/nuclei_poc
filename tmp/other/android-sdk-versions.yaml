  description: |
    This template identifies the `minSdkVersion`, `targetSdkVersion`, and `maxSdkVersion` attributes in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Supporting outdated or vulnerable Android versions can increase the risk of exploitation due to the lack of security features or mitigations present in newer versions.
  remediation: |
    Ensure `minSdkVersion` is set to a version that minimizes exposure to outdated or vulnerable Android versions. Regularly update `targetSdkVersion` to the latest stable version to utilize the most recent security enhancements.
