  description: |
    Fortinet heuristic scanning configuration is advised to thwart attacks. Heuristic scanning is a technique used to identify previously unknown viruses. A value of block enables heuristic AV scanning of binary files and blocks any detected. A replacement message is forwarded to the recipient, and blocked files are quarantined if quarantine is enabled.
