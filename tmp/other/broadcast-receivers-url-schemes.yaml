  name: Android Broadcast Receivers and URL Schemes
  author: YoruYagami
  severity: low
  description: |
    This template identifies exported `Broadcast Receivers` and potential URL scheme misconfigurations in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Broadcast receivers that are exported can be triggered by any application, leading to unintended behavior or exploitation. Insecure URL scheme handling can allow malicious apps to pass untrusted input, potentially leading to vulnerabilities such as intent redirection or privilege escalation.
  remediation: |
    Set `android:exported="false"` for broadcast receivers that do not need to interact with other applications. Validate and sanitize any input received through URL schemes to prevent exploitation and abuse of these components.
