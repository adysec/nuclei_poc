  description: |
    This template identifies potential Tapjacking vulnerabilities by searching for exported activities in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Tapjacking is an attack where a malicious application obscures a victim application's interface and tricks the user into interacting with it. Activities that are exported and lack permission requirements are particularly susceptible to this attack. Additionally, it checks for the `android:filterTouchesWhenObscured` attribute in the layout, which can help mitigate such vulnerabilities.
  remediation: |
    Set `android:filterTouchesWhenObscured="true"` in all sensitive views and ensure that exported activities require proper permissions. Also, ensure that the app targets Android 12 (API 31) or higher, where tapjacking protection is enforced by default.
