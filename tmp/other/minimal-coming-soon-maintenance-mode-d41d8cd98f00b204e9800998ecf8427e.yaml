  name: "Minimal Coming Soon – Coming Soon Page <= 2.33 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Minimal Coming Soon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘custom_css’ and 'custom_html' parameters in versions up to, and including, 2.33 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled."
