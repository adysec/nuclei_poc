  name: "Booking Calendar â€“ Event Calendar <= 1.0.2 - Missing Authorization"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Booking Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on several functions (including omnivo_calendar_ajax_events_settings_save and omnivo_calendar_ajax_omnivo_calendar_delete_shortcode) in versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to invoke those functions leading to setting changes and shortcode deletion among other issues."
