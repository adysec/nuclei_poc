  name: Insecure Intent
  author: YoruYagami
  severity: medium
  description: |
    This template detects the use of insecure intents. Intents that are not properly secured can be intercepted or manipulated by malicious applications, leading to potential security issues.
  remediation: |
    To remediate this issue, ensure that intents are properly secured using permissions and avoid sending sensitive data via intents. Example:

    ```java
    // Secure intents with permissions
    Intent intent = new Intent(this, TargetActivity.class);
    intent.putExtra("EXTRA_DATA", data);
    startActivity(intent);
    ```
