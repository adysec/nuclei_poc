  name: Exported Activities
  author: YoruYagami
  severity: high
  description: |
    This template detects if activities are exported in the Android manifest file. Exporting activities can expose them to other applications, which might lead to unauthorized access or actions within the app. Ensure that only necessary activities are exported and that they are properly secured.
  remediation: |
    To remediate this issue, set the `exported` attribute to `false` for activities that do not need to be accessible by other applications. Example:

    ```xml
    <activity
        android:name=".MyActivity"
        android:exported="false"
        ... >
        ...
    </activity>
    ```

file:
  - extensions:
      - xml

      - type: word
        words:
          - "android:exported=\"true\""
