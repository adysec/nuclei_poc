  name: XML Entities Expansion Injection(SchemaFactory_Validator)
  author: sklnhunt
  severity: medium
  description: XML entity expansion vulnerabilities arise because the XML specification allows XML documents to define entities that reference other entities defined within the document. If this is done recursively to a significant depth, then the XML parser will consume exponentially increasing amounts of memory and processor resources as each level of recursion is processed.
