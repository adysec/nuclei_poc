info:
  name: Exported Content Provider
  author: YoruYagami
  severity: high
  description: |
    This template detects if content providers are exported in the Android manifest file. Exporting content providers can expose them to other applications, which might lead to unauthorized access or actions within the app. Ensure that only necessary content providers are exported and that they are properly secured.
  remediation: |
    To remediate this issue, set the `exported` attribute to `false` for content providers that do not need to be accessible by other applications. Example:

    ```xml
    <provider
        android:name=".MyContentProvider"
        android:authorities="com.example.myapp.provider"
        android:exported="false"
        ... >
        ...
    </provider>
    ```

file:
  - extensions:
      - xml
