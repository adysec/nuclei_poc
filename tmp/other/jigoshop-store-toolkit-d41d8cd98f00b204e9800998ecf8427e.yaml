  name: "Jigoshop – Store Toolkit <= 1.3.8 - Missing Authorization Checks"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Jigoshop – Store Toolkit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the 'jigo_st_admin_init' function in versions up to, and including 1.3.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain access to restricted actions like deleting inactive user accounts, unlinking downloads, and more."
