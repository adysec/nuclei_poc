  name: Insecure Broadcast Receiver
  author: YoruYagami
  severity: high
  description: |
    This template detects insecure broadcast receivers that are exported and do not have proper permissions set. This can lead to unauthorized applications sending or receiving broadcasts, leading to potential security issues.
  remediation: |
    To remediate this issue, ensure that broadcast receivers are not exported unless necessary and that proper permissions are set. Example:

    ```xml
    <receiver android:name=".MyReceiver" android:exported="false">
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="com.example.MY_ACTION"/>
        </intent-filter>
    </receiver>
    ```

file:
  - extensions:
      - xml

    matchers:
      - type: word
        words:
          - "<receiver"
          - "android:exported=\"true\""
