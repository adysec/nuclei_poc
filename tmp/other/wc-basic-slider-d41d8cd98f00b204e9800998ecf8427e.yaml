  name: "Unlimited Category slider for WooCommerce <= 2.0.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Unlimited Category slider for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.0.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the "cx_nonce" function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain otherwise restricted access to administrative actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
