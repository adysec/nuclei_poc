  description: |
    This template identifies potential Task Hijacking vulnerabilities by searching for the `taskAffinity` and `launchMode` attributes in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Task hijacking exploits Android's task and activity management by intercepting activity launches using matching `taskAffinity` values. An attacker can create a malicious app with the same task affinity, leading to unauthorized access or impersonation of the victim application.
  remediation: |
    Set `taskAffinity` to an empty string (`""`) to prevent other applications from sharing the same task affinity. Use the `singleInstance` or `singleTask` launch mode for critical activities to ensure they do not share the same task with other apps. Additionally, customize the `onBackPressed()` method to handle back navigation securely.
