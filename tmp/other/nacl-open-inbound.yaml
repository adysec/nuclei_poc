  name: Open Inbound NACL Traffic
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Checks for Amazon VPC Network ACLs with inbound rules allowing traffic from all IPs across all ports, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.
  impact: |
    Allows unrestricted access to resources within the subnet, potentially exposing sensitive data or services to unauthorized users.
  remediation: |
    Restrict Network ACL inbound rules to only allow necessary IP ranges and ports as per the Principle of Least Privilege.
