  name: Readiness Probes not set in Deployments
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: Checks for missing readiness probes in Kubernetes Deployments, which can lead to traffic being sent to unready containers
  impact: |
    Not configuring readiness probes in Kubernetes Deployments can result in the routing of traffic to containers that are not ready to handle requests, leading to potential downtime or degraded performance.
  remediation: |
    Define readiness probes in all containers within your Kubernetes Deployments to ensure that traffic is only routed to containers that are fully prepared to handle it.
