  severity: medium
  description: |
    This template identifies exported activities, services, or broadcast receivers in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Exported components can be accessed by other applications, potentially leading to unauthorized interactions and misuse. Further analysis during dynamic testing can reveal how to exploit these components.
  remediation: |
    Set `android:exported="false"` for components that do not require interaction with other applications. Review and restrict the usage of exported activities, services, or broadcast receivers to minimize attack surface.
