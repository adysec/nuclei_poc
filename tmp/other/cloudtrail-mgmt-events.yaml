  name: CloudTrail Management Events Logging Not Enabled
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensures Amazon CloudTrail trails are configured to log management events, capturing crucial API calls and console actions for security and audit purposes.
  impact: |
    Failure to log management events can lead to insufficient audit trails, hindering the ability to investigate and respond to suspicious activities.
  remediation: |
    Enable management event logging in CloudTrail by creating a new trail or updating existing trails to include management events.
