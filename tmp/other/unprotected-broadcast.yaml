  severity: medium
  description: |
    This template detects broadcasts that are sent without proper protection. Sending unprotected broadcasts can allow malicious applications to intercept or manipulate the broadcast, leading to security vulnerabilities.
  remediation: |
    To remediate this issue, use permissions to protect broadcasts or use LocalBroadcastManager for local broadcasts. Example:

    ```java
    // Protect broadcasts with permissions
    Intent intent = new Intent("com.example.MY_ACTION");
    sendBroadcast(intent, "com.example.MY_PERMISSION");
    ```
