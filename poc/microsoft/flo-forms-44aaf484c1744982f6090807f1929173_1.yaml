  name: "Flo Forms – Easy Drag & Drop Form Builder <= 1.0.35 - Options Change to Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Flo Forms – Easy Drag & Drop Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Options Change by using the flo_import_forms_options AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 1.0.35 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping along with missing capability checks. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, like subscribers, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
