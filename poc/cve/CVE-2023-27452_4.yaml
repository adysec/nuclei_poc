info:
  name: "Button Generator – easily Button Builder <= 2.3.3 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Button Generator – easily Button Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in versions up to, and including, 2.3.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level access, and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled."
