  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Profiler – What Slowing Down Your WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the wpsd_plugin_control() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reactivate previously deactivated plugins after accessing the "Profiler" page.
