  name: >
    WP Firebase Push Notification <= 1.2.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Broadcast Notification
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Firebase Push Notification plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wfpn_brodcast_notification_message() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send broadcast notifications via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
