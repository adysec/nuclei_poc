    Conditional Payments for WooCommerce <= 3.3.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Conditional Payments for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized action granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
