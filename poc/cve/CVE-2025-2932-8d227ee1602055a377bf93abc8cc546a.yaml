    JKDEVKIT <= 1.9.4 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The JKDEVKIT plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'font_upload_handler' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). If WooCommerce is enabled, attackers will need Contributor-level access and above.
