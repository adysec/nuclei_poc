  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    Several plugins for WordPress by wpcodefactory are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in various versions due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
