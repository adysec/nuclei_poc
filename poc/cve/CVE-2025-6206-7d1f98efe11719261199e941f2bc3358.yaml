    Aiomatic - AI Content Writer, Editor, ChatBot & AI Toolkit <= 2.5.0 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Aiomatic - Automatic AI Content Writer & Editor, GPT-3 & GPT-4, ChatGPT ChatBot & AI Toolkit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'aiomatic_image_editor_ajax_submit' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. In order to exploit the vulnerability, there must be a value entered for the Stability.AI API key. The value can be arbitrary.
