    Wholesale Market for WooCommerce <= 2.0.0 & Wholesale Market <= 2.2.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    Multiple plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in various versions. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'wholesale_market' page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
