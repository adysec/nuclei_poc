  name: "The School Management – Education & Learning Management <= 4.1 - Authenticated (Administrator+) SQL Injection"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The The School Management – Education & Learning Management plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via an unknown parameter in versions up to, and including, 4.1 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers , with administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database."
