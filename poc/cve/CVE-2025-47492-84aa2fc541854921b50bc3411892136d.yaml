    Drag and Drop File Upload for Elementor Forms <= 1.4.3 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Drag and Drop File Upload for Elementor Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the elementor_file_upload_remove() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
