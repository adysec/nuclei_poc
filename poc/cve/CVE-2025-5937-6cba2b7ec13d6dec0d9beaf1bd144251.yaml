    MicroPayments – Fans Paysite: Paid Creator Subscriptions, Digital Assets, Wallet <= 3.2.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings Reset
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The MicroPayments – Fans Paysite: Paid Creator Subscriptions, Digital Assets, Wallet plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the adminOptions() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
