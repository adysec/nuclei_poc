  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The WordPress Classifieds Plugin – Ad Directory & Listings by AWP Classifieds plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the admin_handleimagesupload function in versions up to, and including, 1.8.9.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible."
