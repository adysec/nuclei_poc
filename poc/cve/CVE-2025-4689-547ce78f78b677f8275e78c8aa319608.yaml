    Ads Pro Plugin - Multi-Purpose WordPress Advertising Manager <= 4.89 - Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion to Remote Code Execution
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Ads Pro Plugin - Multi-Purpose WordPress Advertising Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion which leads to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 4.89. This is due to the presence of a SQL Injection vulnerability and Local File Inclusion vulnerability that can be chained with an image upload. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server upload image files on the server than can be fetched via a SQL injection vulnerability, and ultimately executed as PHP code through the local file inclusion vulnerability.
