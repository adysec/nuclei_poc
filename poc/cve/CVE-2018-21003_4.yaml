info:
  name: "Post, Registration and Profile Form Builder – FrontEnd Editor BuddyForms – Easy WordPress Forms <= 2.2.7 - SQL Injection"
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: "The Buddyforms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection in versions up to, and including, 2.2.7 due to insufficient escaping on a user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database."
