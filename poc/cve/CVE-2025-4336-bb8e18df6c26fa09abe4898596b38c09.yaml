    eMagicOne Store Manager for WooCommerce <= 1.2.5 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload via set_file()
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The eMagicOne Store Manager for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the set_file() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This is only exploitable by unauthenticated attackers in default configurations where the the default password is left as 1:1, or where the attacker gains access to the credentials.
