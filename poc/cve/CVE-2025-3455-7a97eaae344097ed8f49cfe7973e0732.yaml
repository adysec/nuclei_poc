    1 Click WordPress Migration Plugin – 100% FREE for a limited time <= 2.2 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The 1 Click WordPress Migration Plugin – 100% FREE for a limited time plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'start_restore' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
