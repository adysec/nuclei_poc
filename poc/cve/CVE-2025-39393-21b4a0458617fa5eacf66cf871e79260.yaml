    Hospital Management System <= 47.0(20-11-2023) - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Hospital Management System for Wordpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in version * -47.0(20-11-2023) due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
