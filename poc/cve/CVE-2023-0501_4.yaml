info:
  name: "WP Insurance – WordPress Insurance Service Plugin <= 2.1.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery leading to Arbitrary Plugin Activation"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The WP Insurance – WordPress Insurance Service Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.1.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'plugin_activation' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate arbitrary plugins already installed (but deactivated) on the site via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
