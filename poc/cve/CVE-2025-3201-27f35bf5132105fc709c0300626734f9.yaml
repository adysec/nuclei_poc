    Contact Form builder with drag & drop for WordPress – Kali Forms <= 2.4.2 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Contact Form builder with drag & drop for WordPress – Kali Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
