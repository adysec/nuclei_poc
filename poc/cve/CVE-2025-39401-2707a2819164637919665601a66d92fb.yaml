    WPAMS <= 44.0 (17-08-2023) - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The WPAMS - Apartment Management System for wordpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in all versions up to, and including, 44.0 (17-08-2023). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
