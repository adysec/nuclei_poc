    MDJM Event Management <= 1.7.6 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The MDJM Event Management plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.6. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like password through the mdjm_validate_client_profile AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.
