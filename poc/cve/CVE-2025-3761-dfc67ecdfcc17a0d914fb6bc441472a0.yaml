  name: >
    My Tickets – Accessible Event Ticketing <= 2.0.16 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The My Tickets – Accessible Event Ticketing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.16. This is due to the mt_save_profile() function not appropriately restricting access to unauthorized users to update roles. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update their role to that of an administrator.
