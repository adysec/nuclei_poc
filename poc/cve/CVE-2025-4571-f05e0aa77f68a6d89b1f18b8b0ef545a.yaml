  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The GiveWP – Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized view and modification of data due to an insufficient capability check on the permissionsCheck functions in all versions up to, and including, 4.3.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to view or delete fundraising campaigns, view donors' data, modify campaign events, etc.
