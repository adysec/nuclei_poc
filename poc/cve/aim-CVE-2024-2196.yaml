info:
  name: CSRF and CORS vulnerability in AIM Dashboardv3.17.5
  author: may
  severity: high
  description: CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery. It is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker tricks a user's browser into making an unintended and potentially malicious request to a web application on which the user is authenticated. This can lead to actions being performed on behalf of the user without their consent. The aim dashboard lacks protection against CSRF and CORS attacks, hence allowing an attacker to trick an user into performing actions on their behalf such as deleting runs from the dashboard.
