    BeeTeam368 Extensions Pro <= 2.3.4 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Directory Traversal to Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The BeeTeam368 Extensions Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.4 via the handle_live_fn() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to perform actions on files outside of the originally intended directory. This vulnerability can be used to delete the wp-config.php file, which can be leveraged into a site takeover.
