    eMagicOne Store Manager for WooCommerce <= 1.2.5 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Read
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The eMagicOne Store Manager for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Reads in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.5 via the get_file() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information. This is only exploitable by unauthenticated attackers in default configurations where the the default password is left as 1:1, or where the attacker gains access to the credentials.
