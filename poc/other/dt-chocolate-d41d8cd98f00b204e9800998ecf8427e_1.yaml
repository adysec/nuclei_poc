  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Chocolate WP – Responsive Photography Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to inclusion of a vulnerable version of TimThumb in all versions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
