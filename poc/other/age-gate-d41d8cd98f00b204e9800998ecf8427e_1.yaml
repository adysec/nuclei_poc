  name: "Age Gate <= 2.16.3 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Age Gate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘Additional content’ field in versions up to, and including, 2.16.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for  authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
