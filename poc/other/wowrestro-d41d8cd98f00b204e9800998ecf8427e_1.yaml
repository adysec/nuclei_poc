  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The WOWRestro – Online Ordering System For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on various AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain restricted access to administrative actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
