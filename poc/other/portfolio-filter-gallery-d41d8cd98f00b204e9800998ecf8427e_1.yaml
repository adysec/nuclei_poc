  name: "Portfolio Gallery â€“ Image Gallery Plugin <= 1.1.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Portfolio Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several actions found in the ~/filters.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform administrative actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
