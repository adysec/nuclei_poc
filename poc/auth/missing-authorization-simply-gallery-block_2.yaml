  name: Gallery Blocks with Lightbox <= 3.0.7 - Missing Authorization in pgc_sgb_add_dashboard_widget
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: The Gallery Blocks with Lightbox plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized data modification due to a missing capability check on the pgc_sgb_add_dashboard_widget function in versions up to, and including, 3.0.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access to retrieve and edit post data and metadata, update and retrieve arbitrary options, retrieve post listings, as well as taxonomy terms and post content.
