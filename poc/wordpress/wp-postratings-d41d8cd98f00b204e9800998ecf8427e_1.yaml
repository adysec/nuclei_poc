  name: "WP-PostRatings <= 1.86 - Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The WP-PostRatings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘postratings_image’ parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.86 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
