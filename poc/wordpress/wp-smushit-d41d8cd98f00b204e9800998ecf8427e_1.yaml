  name: "Smush – Lazy Load Images, Optimize & Compress Images <= 3.0.0 - Authenticated PHAR Deserialization"
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: "The Smush – Lazy Load Images, Optimize & Compress Images plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted input via the '$log_file' value in versions up to, and including 3.0.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize the data and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload."
