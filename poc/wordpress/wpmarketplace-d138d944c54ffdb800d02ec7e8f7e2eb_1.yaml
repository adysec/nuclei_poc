  name: "WP Marketplace – Complete Shopping Cart / eCommerce Solution <= 1.2.1 - Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: "The WP Marketplace – Complete Shopping Cart / eCommerce Solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the uploadify/check.php and uploadify/uploadify.php files in versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This makes it possible for attackers o upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible."
