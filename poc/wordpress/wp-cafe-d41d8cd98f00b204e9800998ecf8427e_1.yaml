  name: "WPCafe – Food Menu, WooCommerce Food Ordering, Food Delivery, Pickup and Restaurant Reservation <= 2.1.4 - Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The WPCafe – Food Menu, WooCommerce Food Ordering, Food Delivery, Pickup and Restaurant Reservation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including 2.1.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the wpc_location_id parameter. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser."
