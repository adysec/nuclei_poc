    Welcart e-Commerce <= 2.11.13 - Authenticated (Editor+) Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in a function in all versions up to, and including, 2.11.13. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Editor-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
