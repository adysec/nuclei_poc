  name: >
    Grand Restaurant WordPress <= 7.0 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Options Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Grand Restaurant WordPress theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to a denial of service due to a missing capability check on a function in all versions up to, and including, 7.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary option values on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to delete an option that would create an error on the site and deny service to legitimate users.
