  description: "This module enables you to create facet-filters for results of a search query and exposes them as blocks The module doesnt sufficiently escape HTML under the scenario leading to a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability is mitigated by two factors. First, an attacker must have a way to insert results in the dataset that is exposed as a facet before this can happen. The permission to inject malicious strings depends on the sites search configuration but could be available to any user who can create content in a site. Second, the site must be using the Javascript-based dropdown widget."
