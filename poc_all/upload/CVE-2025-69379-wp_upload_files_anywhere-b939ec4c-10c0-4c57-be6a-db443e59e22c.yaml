  name: >
    Upload Files Anywhere <= 2.8 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The WordPress Upload Files Anywhere plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in a function in all versions up to, and including, 2.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
