    Ultimate Member <= 2.11.1 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via Filter Parameters
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Ultimate Member – User Profile, Registration, Login, Member Directory, Content Restriction & Membership Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the filter parameters (e.g., 'filter_first_name') in all versions up to, and including, 2.11.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
