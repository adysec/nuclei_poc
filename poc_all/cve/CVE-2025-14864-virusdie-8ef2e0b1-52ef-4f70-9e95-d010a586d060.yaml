info:
  name: >
    Virusdie <= 1.1.7 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) API Key Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Virusdie - One-click website security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.7. This is due to missing capability checks on the `vd_get_apikey` function which is hooked to `wp_ajax_virusdie_apikey`. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve the site's Virusdie API key, which could be used to access the site owner's Virusdie account and potentially compromise site security.
