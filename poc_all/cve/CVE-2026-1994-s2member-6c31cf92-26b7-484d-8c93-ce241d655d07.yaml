  name: >
    s2Member <= 260127 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The s2Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 260127. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.
