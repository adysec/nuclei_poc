    Forminator Forms – Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder <= 1.50.2 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Forminator Forms – Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the form_name parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.50.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The plugin allows admins to give form management permissions to lower level users, which could make this exploitable by users such as subscribers.
