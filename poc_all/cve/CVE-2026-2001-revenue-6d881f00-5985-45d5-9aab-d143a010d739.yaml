  name: >
    WowRevenue <= 2.1.3 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Plugin Installation/Activation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WowRevenue plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized plugin installation due to a missing capability check in the 'Notice::install_activate_plugin' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to install arbitrary plugins on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
