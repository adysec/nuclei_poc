  name: >
    OneClick Chat to Order <= 1.0.9 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Editor+) Plugin Settings Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The OneClick Chat to Order plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.0.9. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action in the wa_order_number_save_number_field function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Editor-level access and above, to modify WhatsApp phone numbers used by the plugin, redirecting customer orders and messages to attacker-controlled phone numbers.
