  name: >
    WP AUDIO GALLERY <= 2.0 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Read via .htaccess Manipulation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP AUDIO GALLERY plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthorized Arbitrary File Read in all versions up to, and including, 2.0. This is due to insufficient capability checks and lack of nonce verification on the "wpag_htaccess_callback" function This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to overwrite the site's .htaccess file with arbitrary content, which can lead to arbitrary file read on the server under certain configurations.
