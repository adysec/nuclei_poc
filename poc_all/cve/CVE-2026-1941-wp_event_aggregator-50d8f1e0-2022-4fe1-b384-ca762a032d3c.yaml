    WP Event Aggregator <= 1.8.7 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Shortcode Attributes
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Event Aggregator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'wp_events' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
