    Gutenberg Blocks with AI by Kadence WP <= 3.6.1 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Contributor+) Unauthorized Media Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Gutenberg Blocks with AI by Kadence WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.1. This is due to a missing capability check in the `process_image_data_ajax_callback()` function which handles the `kadence_import_process_image_data` AJAX action. The function's authorization check via `verify_ajax_call()` only validates `edit_posts` capability but fails to check for the `upload_files` capability. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to upload arbitrary images from remote URLs to the WordPress Media Library, bypassing the standard WordPress capability restriction that prevents Contributors from uploading files.
