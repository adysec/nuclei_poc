  name: >
    WP Import – Ultimate CSV XML Importer for WordPress <= 7.37 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) SQL Injection via File Name
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Import – Ultimate CSV XML Importer for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection in all versions up to, and including, 7.37. This is due to insufficient escaping on the `file_name` parameter which is stored in the database during file upload and later used in raw SQL queries without proper sanitization. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access or higher to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries via a malicious filename, which can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. The vulnerability can only be exploited when the 'Single Import/Export' option is enabled, and the server is running a PHP version < 8.0.
