  name: >
    Buyent Theme (with Buyent Classified Plugin) <= 1.0.7 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via User Registration
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Buyent Classified plugin for WordPress (bundled with Buyent theme) is vulnerable to privilege escalation via user registration in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.7. This is due to the plugin not validating or restricting the user role during registration via the REST API endpoint. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register accounts with arbitrary roles, including administrator, by manipulating the _buyent_classified_user_type parameter during the registration process, granting them complete control over the WordPress site.
