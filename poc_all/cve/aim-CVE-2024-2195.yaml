id: CVE-2024-2195

info:
  name: Aim - Remote Code Execution3.16.2
  author: may
  severity: critical
  description: |
    The Aim application is vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the "/api/runs/search/run" endpoint, which allows executing arbitrary commands on the target system.

    The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation and improper handling of user-supplied data in the "q" parameter of the "/api/runs/search/run" endpoint. The application fails to properly sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to inject and execute malicious code.

  impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to complete compromise of the affected system, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, and potentially move laterally within the network.

  remediation: |
    - Update the application to a patched version that addresses this vulnerability.
    - Implement proper input validation and sanitization mechanisms for user-supplied data.
    - Follow the principle of least privilege and ensure that the application runs with the minimal required permissions.
    - Regularly review and update the application's security posture.
