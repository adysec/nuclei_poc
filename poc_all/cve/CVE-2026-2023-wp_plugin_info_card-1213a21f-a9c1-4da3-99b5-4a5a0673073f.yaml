    WP Plugin Info Card <= 6.2.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Custom Plugin Entry Creation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Plugin Info Card plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 6.2.0. This is due to missing nonce validation in the ajax_save_custom_plugin() function, which is disabled by prefixing the check with 'false &&'. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create or modify custom plugin entries via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
