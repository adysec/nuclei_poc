    WP-DownloadManager <= 1.69 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Path Traversal to Arbitrary File Deletion via 'file' Parameter
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP-DownloadManager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Path Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 1.69 via the 'file' parameter in the file deletion functionality. This is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied file paths, allowing directory traversal sequences. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can lead to remote code execution when critical files like wp-config.php are deleted.
