    Whatsiplus Scheduled Notification for Woocommerce <= 1.0.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to 'wsnfw_save_users_settings' AJAX Action
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Whatsiplus Scheduled Notification for Woocommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'wsnfw_save_users_settings' AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin configuration settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
