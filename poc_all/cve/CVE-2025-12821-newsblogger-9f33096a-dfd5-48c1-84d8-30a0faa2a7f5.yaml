    NewsBlogger <= 0.2.5.6 - 0.2.6.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Plugin Installation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The NewsBlogger theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions 0.2.5.6  to 0.2.6.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the newsblogger_install_and_activate_plugin() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files and achieve remote code execution via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This is due to a reverted fix of CVE-2025-1305.
