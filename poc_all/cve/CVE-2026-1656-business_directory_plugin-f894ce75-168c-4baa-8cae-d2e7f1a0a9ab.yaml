  name: >
    Business Directory Plugin <= 6.4.20 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Listing Modification
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Business Directory Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing authorization check in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.20. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify arbitrary listings, including changing titles, content, and email addresses, by directly referencing the listing ID in crafted requests to the wpbdp_ajax AJAX action.
